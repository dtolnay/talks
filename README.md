### License

- The `pygments` directory contains a tweaked [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)
  lexer and color scheme for Rust. The original Rust support in Pygments
  (correctly) colors certain things as syntax errors that I wanted to be colored
  valid in the Macros 1.1 talk. This code is licensed under Pygments' BSD
  license.
- The Macros 1.1 talk has some Beamer \*.sty files based on
